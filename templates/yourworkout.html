   <h2>Your Workout Plan</h2>
   <p>In our first meeting consultation we meet up to discuss you: 
    <ul>
     <li>your goals </li>
     <li>what you want from your personal training sessions</li>
     <li>what changes you wish to see in yourself physically and mentally</li>
     <li>any potential challenges you can foresee and how we can mitigate these</li>
     <li>and then we will go over your short-term goals in order to achieve your transformation</li>
     <li>and discuss a personalised plan of what you need to do to get there</li>
   </ul> 
 </p>
 <br>
 <p> This will form the basis of your personal workout plan and will be tailored to your needs, and around your life as much as possible. <br>Whatever your goals may be, should it be getting beach beautiful, improving your health physically or mentally, improving fitness, training for a marathon or other, a plan will be made between us, and will be your commitment to your fitness and health journey ahead.</p>

    <h2 id="mytransformation">My Transformation</h2>
    <p>In April of last year I set a challenge for myself, I cut down my intake of calories for 4 months and went from 76.6kg down to 70.8kg. Below is the result, the first picture was taken 19/4/16 and the second picture on 22/8/16.
      It took a lot of discipline, patience and focus to achieve this. I'm a massive food lover so going from a 4000 calorie daily diet slowly down to 1700-1800 was very tough. But if I can do it, anyone can! 
      You just need to have the right mindset if you want to make a change.

    This of course was not nutrition alone I still kept up my workout programme, I went to the gym regularly and work out 5-6 days a week with a rest day each week.</p>
