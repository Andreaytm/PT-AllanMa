          <p>As explained sessions will be tailored to you at our first session we will go over and create a workout
            plan that works for you with your goals, achieveable challenges. Each session will always include
            stretching, a warming up and cooling off period, this is to ensure your body is ready for exercise and to
            not shock your system.

          <p>It is difficult to say. Each individual is different and will have their own lifestyle, workout goals,
            challenges and different starting points. Seeing physical results can also vary depending on current eating
            habits, biology and exercise habits. I can say that you will likely feel the results first: from reps
            getting easier to feeling a lot happier doing exercise.I can say that if you put more effort and energy into
            your workout you will likely get the results you are looking for sooner, especially with the right
            nutrition, motivation and mindset.</p>
